Project Description:

This project was made with Python for users to calculate the amount of tip they pay for food. 


Project Breakdown:

Line 1: food_amount variable is created, input() is used to ask the user to enter a food
amount, the input() resides within float() because we do not want a string or an integer.

Line 2: tip_percentage variable is created, input() is used to ask the user to enter a tip
percentage from 1 - 100, the input() resides within float() becuase we do not want a string
or an integer.

Line 3: Blank line to make the code more readable

Line 4: tip_amount variable is created, the food amount and tip_percentage are multiplied to get 
the tip amount.

Line 5: total_amount variable is created, food_amount is added to tip_amount to find the total

Line 6 : Blank line to make code more readable

Line 7: A print statement is used to print multiplpe dashes to make the output more appealing and
easy to read.

Line 8: A print statement is used to the food amount, string formatting is also used.

Line 9: A print statement is used to print the tip amount, \n is used to create a new line in the output
so the output is easier to read, string formatting was also used.

Line 10: A print statement is used to print the total amount, string formatting is also used.

Line 11: A print statemet is used print multiple dashes to make the ouput more visually appealing.

Line 12: Blank line
